Introduction of ER Model :-

The entity relational model is a model for identifying entities to be represented in the database and representation of how those entities are related.
The ER data model specifies enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database graphically.
The entity relationship diagram explains the relationship among the entities present in the database.
ER models are used to model real-world objects like a person, a car, or a company and the relation between these real-world objects.
In short, ER Diagram is the structural format of the database.
 
Components of ER Diagram :-

ER Model consists of Entities, Attributes, and Relationships in a Database System. 

1. Entity
An Entity may be an object with a physical existence – a particular person, car, house, or employee – or it may be an object with a conceptual existence – a company, a job, or a university course.

1) Strong Entity
A Strong Entity is a type of entity that has a key Attribute. 
Strong Entity does not depend on other Entity in the Schema. 
It has a primary key, that helps in identifying it uniquely, and it is represented by a rectangle. 
These are called Strong Entity Types.

2) Weak Entity
An entity that depends on another entity called a weak entity. 
The weak entity doesn't contain any key attribute of its own. 
The weak entity is represented by a double rectangle.
These are called Weak Entity types. 

 
2. Attribute
Attributes are the properties that define the entity type. 
For example, Roll No, Name, DOB, Age, Address, and Mobile No are the attributes that define entity type Student. 
In ER diagram, the attribute is represented by an oval.

1) Key Attribute
The attribute which uniquely identifies each entity in the entity set is called the key attribute. 
For example, Roll No will be unique for each student. 
In ER diagram, the key attribute is represented by an oval with underlying lines.

2) Composite Attribute
An attribute composed of many other attributes is called a composite attribute. 
For example, the Address attribute of the student Entity type consists of Street, City, State, and Country. 
In ER diagram, the composite attribute is represented by an oval comprising of ovals.

3) Multivalued Attributes
An attribute consisting of more than one value for a given entity. 
For example, Phone No (can be more than one for a given student). 
In ER diagram, a multivalued attribute is represented by a double oval.

4) Derived Attributes
An attribute that can be derived from other attributes of the entity type is known as a derived attribute. e.g.; Age (can be derived from DOB). 
In ER diagram, the derived attribute is represented by a dashed oval.


3. Relationship
A relationship is used to describe the relation between entities. Diamond or rhombus is used to represent the relationship.
